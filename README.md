This is a simple script written in Bash and PHP. You can edit it to your liking, you could even move the PHP part to the Bash script, or put everything in the PHP script and make it executable. If you need more functions, please send me a email and i will happily share more functions relating to IPTV, M3U and converting to STRM files.
